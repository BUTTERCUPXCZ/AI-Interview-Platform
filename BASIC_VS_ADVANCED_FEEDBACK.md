## üíé PRO Plan - Advanced AI Feedback

### Per-Question Evaluation (`evaluateAnswer`)
**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this answer to an interview question in detail.
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Provide specific, detailed feedback with examples of what was good and what could be improved.
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Detailed, comprehensive feedback
- ‚úÖ Specific examples from the answer
- ‚úÖ Precise scoring (0-10)
- ‚úÖ Actionable improvement suggestions

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "score": 7,
  "aiEvaluation": "Good understanding of React hooks demonstrated. You correctly explained useState and useEffect. However, you missed discussing the dependency array in useEffect, which is crucial for optimization. Consider mentioning cleanup functions and how they prevent memory leaks. Strong grasp of basic concepts but depth could be improved with real-world examples."
}
```

### Overall Session Analysis (`analyzeSession`)
**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Analyze this interview session in detail.
Provide comprehensive, detailed feedback with specific examples and actionable insights.
Include specific areas of strength, detailed weaknesses, and concrete improvement steps.
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive, in-depth analysis
- ‚úÖ Specific examples from user's answers
- ‚úÖ Detailed strengths and weaknesses
- ‚úÖ Concrete, actionable improvement steps
- ‚úÖ Resource recommendations

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "overallScore": 7.2,
  "strengths": "You demonstrated strong knowledge of React fundamentals, particularly in explaining component lifecycle and state management. Your answer about hooks showed practical understanding with good code examples. Communication was clear and well-structured throughout the interview.",
  "weaknesses": "Your explanation of async/await lacked detail about error handling with try-catch blocks. When discussing API integration, you didn't mention important concepts like CORS or authentication headers. The system design question needed more consideration of scalability and edge cases.",
  "improvementTips": "Study error handling patterns in asynchronous JavaScript, particularly Promise rejection and async/await error handling. Review RESTful API best practices including authentication, CORS, and status codes. Practice system design by breaking down problems into components, considering data flow, scalability, and failure scenarios. Work through coding challenges on LeetCode focusing on async patterns and API integration."
}
```

## üîÑ Implementation Flow

### When User Submits an Answer

```typescript
// 1. Get user's subscription plan
const subscription = await prisma.subscription.findUnique({ 
    where: { userId } 
});
const isPro = subscription?.planType === 'PRO';

// 2. Call appropriate evaluation function
const evaluation = isPro
    ? await evaluateAnswer(question, answer)      // Detailed AI feedback
    : await evaluateAnswerBasic(question, answer); // Basic AI feedback

// 3. Save to database
await prisma.interviewQuestion.update({
    where: { id: questionId },
    data: {
        userAnswer,
        aiEvaluation: evaluation.aiEvaluation,
        score: evaluation.score,
    },
});
```

### When Generating Overall Feedback

```typescript
// 1. Get user's subscription plan
const subscription = await prisma.subscription.findUnique({ 
    where: { userId } 
});
const isPro = subscription?.planType === 'PRO';

// 2. Call appropriate analysis function
const aiReport = isPro 
    ? await analyzeSession(questions)      // Comprehensive analysis
    : await analyzeSessionBasic(questions); // Brief analysis

// 3. Save to database
await prisma.aIAnalysis.create({
    data: {
        sessionId,
        overallScore: aiReport.overallScore,
        strengths: aiReport.strengths,
        weaknesses: aiReport.weaknesses,
        improvementTips: aiReport.improvementTips,
    },
});
```
