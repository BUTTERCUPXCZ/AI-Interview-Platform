# Production Deployment Configuration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GSAP Animation Errors
- Removed animation for non-existent `.hero-badge` element
- Added conditional check to ensure elements exist before animating

### 2. 401 Authentication Errors in Production

The 401 errors occur because of cross-origin cookie issues between your frontend and backend. Here's what was fixed:

#### Backend Changes:
1. **CORS Configuration** - Updated to support multiple origins and proper credentials
2. **Cookie Settings** - Changed `sameSite` to `"none"` in production for cross-origin cookies
3. **Secure Cookies** - Enabled `secure: true` in production (requires HTTPS)

#### Frontend Changes:
1. **Production Environment** - Created `.env.production` with production API URL
2. **Error Handling** - Improved 401 error handling to prevent console spam

## Environment Variables Setup

### Backend (.env)

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com,http://localhost:5173

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
DIRECT_URL="your-direct-database-url"

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3h

# Other configs...
```

### Frontend (.env.production)

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api
```

## Deployment Checklist

### For Render.com (or similar platforms):

#### Backend:
1. ✅ Set `NODE_ENV=production` in environment variables
2. ✅ Add your frontend URL to `FRONTEND_URL` (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
3. ✅ Ensure your backend is deployed with HTTPS (Render provides this automatically)
4. ✅ Verify database connection strings are correct

#### Frontend:
1. ✅ Create `.env.production` with your backend API URL
2. ✅ Deploy to a platform that supports HTTPS (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. ✅ Verify the build includes the production environment variables

### Testing Authentication in Production:

1. **Clear Browser Cookies** - Old cookies might interfere
2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Login request should return `Set-Cookie` header
   - Cookie should have `Secure` and `SameSite=None` attributes
   - Subsequent requests should include the cookie
3. **Verify CORS headers** - Response should include:
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://your-frontend.com`
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Cookies not being sent in production
**Solution**: 
- Ensure both frontend and backend use HTTPS
- Verify `sameSite: "none"` and `secure: true` in cookie settings
- Check CORS origin matches exactly (including protocol and port)

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env` to match your deployed frontend
- Ensure backend CORS middleware includes `credentials: true`

### Issue: 401 errors persist
**Solution**:
- Check backend logs to see if cookies are received
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set correctly
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Test with Postman/Insomnia to isolate frontend vs backend issues

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
⚠️ **HTTPS Required**: Cross-site cookies with `SameSite=None` require HTTPS
⚠️ **Cookie Domain**: Don't set a domain in cookie options unless you know what you're doing

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Backend - Check environment
echo $NODE_ENV
echo $FRONTEND_URL

# Frontend - Check build
npm run build
# Verify .env.production is being used

# Test API endpoint
curl -i https://your-backend.com/api/auth/me
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy backend with updated environment variables
2. Deploy frontend with `.env.production` file
3. Test login flow in production
4. Monitor browser console and network tab for any remaining issues
